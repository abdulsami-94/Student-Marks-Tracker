# Student Marks Tracker

A simple project I built to learn how to use JavaScript Arrays and Objects.

## 🚀 What it does
1. Takes HTML input from the user  
2. Converts string inputs into numbers  
3. Creates a student object  
4. Stores all students in an array  
5. Dynamically updates the DOM to show the stored data
